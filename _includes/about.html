                <h2>About Natasha</h2>
                <p>Natasha is a biotechnologist-turned-computer-scientist with a passion for writing and learning more about cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things. When she's not imprisoned by WPI's cruel course loads, she enjoys spending time with her friends, watching Netflix (without the chill), playing drums in the WPI Pep Band, and learning new programming tricks.</p>
                <p>Outside of campus life, Natasha is an ardent believer in Jesus, and devotes much of her free time (and more than a few volunteer hours) to serving in churches both local and abroad. Before even coming to WPI, she took a year off to serve and learn as a leadership disciple with the Vineyard Heroic Leadership Institute, learning more about God and serving communities near and far.</p>
